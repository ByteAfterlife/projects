However, my family didn't like the limits: No video, no screensharing. Now, I've known about <a href="https://jitsi.org">Jitsi Meet</a> for a while. Not the cloud hosted one they provide, but the self hosted one. Jitsi Meet is a self hostable server app that lets you have meetings with people (screenshare and video and much more included) Now I'm gonna be completely transparent and say I've failed lots of times setting up an actually working Jitsi server. But this time it was surprisingly easy, I downloaded their pre-made <a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/the-docker-rabbit-hole/">docker</a> compose file, it worked surprisingly! I was expecting 3 hours of debugging to just get the welcome screen, let alone a working meeting. But surprisingly, it worked first try, I got into a meeting, and everything was working. Now, I needed some form of authentication, if this was internally running on my LAN network, it wouldn't matter too much, but if I'm gonna port forward this and make it publicly accessible, I need some sort of security. Then I found myself configuring it to use an LDAP backend, and I added to the docker compose file an <a href="https://github.com/lldap/lldap">LLDAP</a>&nbsp;(Light LDAP) (not LDAP) server. LLDAP is the simplest implementation of an LDAP server I know. It requires minimal setup, and definitely doesn't require 1 hour of commands to add an attribute. It even includes a web interface to manage users. Awesome! Now I was originally considering using Jitsi's internal user system for authentication, because Jitsi's user auth manager, prosody, lets you just internally create users with passwords in it's database and you can use that. But I like a clean web UI, so yes, I deployed a LDAP server just so I get a pretty web interface for managing users. I don't care that much, this isn't a enterprise grade server for millions of concurrent clients, I'm running these off my laptop for ~4 people, so I don't mind too much on resource usage. So just like that, my stack is done! Jitsi meet + LDAP for user management was epic. Then I setup the port forwarding and stuff, and just like that, we did it! Here's some screenshots.</p><div class="gallery-wrapper gallery-wrapper--wide"><div class="gallery" data-columns="3"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/9/gallery/Screenshot-from-2025-12-06-09-02-53.png" data-size="1919x951"><img loading="lazy" src="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/9/gallery/Screenshot-from-2025-12-06-09-02-53-thumbnail.png" height="357" width="720" alt=""></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/9/gallery/Screenshot-from-2025-12-06-09-01-06.png" data-size="590x141"><img loading="lazy" src="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/9/gallery/Screenshot-from-2025-12-06-09-01-06-thumbnail.png" height="141" width="590" alt=""></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/9/gallery/Screenshot-from-2025-12-06-09-04-06.png" data-size="416x385"><img loading="lazy" src="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/9/gallery/Screenshot-from-2025-12-06-09-04-06-thumbnail.png" height="385" width="416" alt=""></a></figure></div></div><p>UPDATE: Ok so something was very wrong, any user that joins gets moderator rights... so what I had to do is enable guests, then take a completely different approach. Instead of everyone in my family having an account on LDAP, I just have one, since I guess Jitsi just gives all LDAP users moderator in meetings. But now that guests are enabled, anyone can join the meeting. The only time they cant is when a moderator isn't in the meeting, but if a moderator is in the meeting, they can just join, now I could enable the lobby, which would 100% solve the problem, but what if I forget? Well I just discovered a <a href="https://github.com/jitsi-contrib/prosody-plugins/tree/main/lobby_autostart_on_owner">community made plugin called "lobby_autostart_on_owner"</a>&nbsp;that automatically enables the lobby after a moderator joins to prevent users from joining without a moderator's permission. So the new flow: Only I have an account, the lobby is automatically enabled whenever I join so I don't have to remember to myself. Fine solution for now I guess, I also removed LLDAP completely since all that just for one user account is a bit too much, so now its just internally managed via that prosody internal database I mentioned earlier.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on December 6, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbyteafterlife.github.io%2Fprojects%2Fbye-mumble-hello-jitsi%2F&amp;via=%40byteafterlife&amp;text=Bye%20Mumble%2C%20Hello%20Jitsi" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/authors/byte/" rel="author">Byte</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/i-made-my-own-vpn/" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> I made my own VPN (second worldwide project)</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/i-made-my-own-encoding-language-out-of-shapes/" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> I made my own encoding language.. out of shapes</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Thanks for reading! &lt;3</p></div><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://x.com/byteafterlife" aria-label="X"><svg><use xlink:href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg></a></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');

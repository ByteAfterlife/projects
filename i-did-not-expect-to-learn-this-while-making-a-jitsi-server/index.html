Same day yesterday, I tried making a client certificate for one of my family members, as I did, it said "Certificate password is incorrect" when I tried importing the PFX on their system, and I was super confused, I even tried verifying the password myself with openssl, and it worked. Today, I tried making one for another family member, and on their phone, same thing, "Enter correct password" it said. I was so confused. Why? The password was correct. I even tried empty passwords (yes, you can make pfx's with empty passwords if you didnt know) AND IT STILL SAID WRONG. YOU CANNOT MAKE A TYPO ON A EMPTY PASSWORD. I knew I'm not going crazy.. right? They typed it correctly, I tried an empty one, they didnt type anything, and it still said its wrong. WHYYYY. I already knew its probably something with compatibility, my system is very up to date, theirs.. well I wont say. Anyway, I WAS RIGHT. 2 hours ago, I discovered the encryption algorithm that my certificate creator was using by default was not compatible with older devices. I then bragged to myself about how I knew it was something with compatibility because I had to let it out. Anyway, then after some extra parameters in the final command to bundle the key and certificate into a cute pfx, it actually imported successfully. See? I knew I wasn't going crazy. I KNEW ITTTTT. Anyway, now I learned that pfx's have different algorithms for.. encrypting themselves. Damn like just stick to one. In my family members' older devices' defense, it was saying the password was wrong because it couldn't decrypt the keys and certificates with the password because it was using a more secure and modern encryption algorithm that they have not ever seen in their lives.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on December 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbyteafterlife.github.io%2Fprojects%2Fi-did-not-expect-to-learn-this-while-making-a-jitsi-server%2F&amp;via=%40byteafterlife&amp;text=I%20did%20not%20expect%20to%20learn%20this%20while%20making%20a%20Jitsi%20server" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/authors/byte/" rel="author">Byte</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/my-jitsi-project-is-really-getting-huge-client-certificate-authentication/" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> My Jitsi Project is really getting huge (client certificate authentication)</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/i-made-social-credit-for-cats-and-learned-so-much/" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> I made social credit for cats (and learned so much)</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/authors/byte/" class="feed__author">Byte</a> <time datetime="2025-12-29T09:22" class="feed__date">December 29, 2025</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/i-made-social-credit-for-cats-and-learned-so-much/">I made social credit for cats (and learned so much)</a></h3></header><p>From my many years of dev experience, I've been building apps that follow this logic: Client connects to server &gt; Server does access verification and makes sure you can access what you wnt &gt; The server queries database &gt; Server returns response to client.

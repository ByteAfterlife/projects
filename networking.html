So, there's two types of IP's. Theres "private IPs" and "public IPs" how they work is when you connect to a Wifi network or connect via ethernet, the router gives your device (phone, laptop, tablet, computer) this magic number called a Private IP, this is used for the router to identify you, and also so other devices can identify you, if your device is also hosting a server (mine has hosted many ;D) then other devices on that same network (example: wifi network) can use the private IP the router assigned you to access that server that your device is hosting. Now, what if you want people outside your (wifi) network to access your server? Well then people will need your Public IP and you'll need to change some router settings.</p><p>So, you're hosting a minecraft server on your computer and you want your friends to join but they arent on your wifi network? Cool! Here's an explination. First: Go to your router settings, now, this varies by router. Now, go to port forwarding (some call it something else), setup port forwarding (I can't be specific because again it's specific to your router brand and model, but you can usually just google "(your router creator and model) port forwarding tutorial" and you'll see step by step), then run the server on your computer, make sure your firewall allows the connections, and you're done. this applies to any server, not just minecraft. Now, your friends will use (your public IP):(port) to connect.</p><p>Also, just to reenforce private IP's are network specific, let me make 2 examples. First, technical one. Lets say my private IP the router gave my laptop is 192.168.56.12, well, if my friend on a different wifi network tries connecting to 192.168.56.12, they can't, the router will be confused, unless the router assigned 192.168.56.12 to another device like maybe his phone then he'd be connected to his phone, not my laptop. Here's a real life example, pretty easy to understand. Let's say you have a room, 1st door 2nd floor. If your friend went to his 2nd floor in his house and opened the 1st door, he wouldn't be in your room. Simple.&nbsp;</p><h4 id="domains-intro">Domains intro</h4><p>But here's the problem, this is a good setup for a one time event, but what about for a 24/7 server? Well you may be wondering "What's the problem now? I set everything up, it should be ok forever now right?" WRONG. Ok so basically most router's that are for home use, like your or my parent's router change the public IP! I know, shameful. lol. So, how do we deal with that? Well so far my best solution is Domains. What are domains? Welcome to the next chapter.</p><h2 id="domains">Domains</h2><p>Domains, you see them everywhere, google.com, example.com, this website right here is on a domain! But what are they? Ever wondered whats happening behind the scenes when you hit enter after typing "google.com" Probably not, I don't blame you honestly. WELL TOO BAD you've read everything before this part already so that means you're interested in what I have to say (thanks!) So, domains have these things called records, there are lots of types of records, to be honest I don't understand many, but most websites use CNAME or A, those basically point to a server from what I know. A points to an IP, I don't really know how CNAME works honestly. So, here's how you would setup a domain for your minecraft server.</p><h2 id="minecraft-server-sample">Minecraft server sample</h2><ol><li>Make sure you setup port forwarding, the minecraft server itself, and your firewall is ready</li><li>Get your Public IP (you can search "what is my ip")</li><li>Go to your domain and make an A record, set the value to the public IP you got</li><li>You're done.</li></ol><p>Lets say the domain you got is example.org, and your minecraft server is on port 25565, here's how it would work behind the scenes:</p><ol><li>Your friend types example.org:25565</li><li>Your computer looks up the records for example.org</li><li>It finds the A record leading to your public IP (lets say 1.1.1.1)</li><li>It connects to 1.1.1.1:25565</li><li>Your router (1.1.1.1) checks it's port forwarding settings for port 25565</li><li>It see's you made a setting to forward port 25565 to port 25565 on your computer</li><li>Your router connects to <u><em>port</em></u> 25565 on your computer and <em><u>forwards</u></em> all data sent through your friend's computer to yours.</li></ol><p>So basically your router is this huge proxy that points connections to the right place.</p><h2 id="the-i-know-your-ip-i-own-you-theory">The "I know your IP, I own you" theory</h2><p>Ever been online and seen people threatening each other with their IP's or something, saying they know where the person lives or whatever, yeah thats actually a lie. Firstly, this IP they're talking about is the person's Public IP as we learned previously. Well, your ISP (the people that you pay for internet) has a building somewhere in your city or another city, and that's where your public IP's location is usually. Not your house. Sometimes, if your ISP doesn't have a building in your city, your public IP's location may even be set to the city beside yours because that's the closest building your ISP has.</p><h2 id="done">Done</h2><p>I probably know more about networking, right now I just can't think of anything else. Sorry!</p><p>There's also SSL certificates and that stuff but I think thats a topic for a different time.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on November 29, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbyteafterlife.github.io%2Fprojects%2Fnetworking.html&amp;via=%40byteafterlife&amp;text=Networking" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/authors/byte/" rel="author">Byte</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/my-first-worldwide-project-mumble.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><figure class="content__nav-image"><img src="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/5/responsive/Untitled-2025-11-07-1050-xs.jpg" class="lazyload" loading="lazy" alt="" height="108" width="108"></figure><div><span>Previous</span> My first worldwide project (Mumble)</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/using-linux-as-my-main-os-for-the-first-time.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Using Linux as my Main OS for the first time</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Thanks for reading! &lt;3</p></div><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://x.com/byteafterlife" aria-label="X"><svg><use xlink:href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg></a></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');

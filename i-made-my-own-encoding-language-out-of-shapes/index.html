Also this went through many revisions because I got more ideas for what to add and probably will get more, if they do, I'll make sure to post it here!</p><p>So I was bored one day and came up with a encoding language.. There's 2 rows. One is the "grouping" row, the next is the "index" row as I call it, you group the alphabet letters into groups of 3, so group 1 is "ABC", group 2 is "DEF", 3 is "GHI", and group 9 is "YZ" now, originally I didnt plan to use shapes, I planned to use dots. Anyway how the rows used to work is the first row, the "grouping" row is for which group of letters your letter is in, let's say I want to write the message "Hi" what we'd do is since the letter "H" is in the "GHI" group, which is 3, we put 3 dots in the first column, first row, to represent "GHI." by the way you can make these rows with just some simple lines, nothing complicated like a special algorithm for the columns. Now, in the second row, first column, we'd put two dots, why? well H is 2nd in the "GHI" group just like that, we wrote H in my silly language, for I, 2nd column first row would be 3 dots again for "GHI", then 3 dots 2nd row 2nd column for I. And we just wrote "HI" (haven't invented capitalisation yet!) Also I didn't really make a requirement for how the dots have to be placed, you can put them in a straight line, a triangle for 3, square for 4, whatever, as long as its within the row and row and column. Here's what it would look like saying "HI"</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/sl1-2.png" height="230" width="209" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl1-2-xs.png 640w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl1-2-sm.png 768w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl1-2-md.png 1024w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl1-2-lg.png 1366w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl1-2-xl.png 1600w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl1-2-2xl.png 1920w"></figure><p>Also I made sure to place the dots randomly to show THE DOT PLACEMENT DOESNT MATTER as long as its contained in your cell (row and column). Now, this was V1 of my secret language, so once when I arranged the dots like a triangle, I realized "Wait why don't we just use shapes?" So I decided to use shapes. Also you may use a dot for 1, so for "A" you would put a dot in column 1 row 1, and another in column 1 row 2. Now "HI" looked like this:</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/sl2.png" height="230" width="209" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl2-xs.png 640w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl2-sm.png 768w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl2-md.png 1024w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl2-lg.png 1366w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl2-xl.png 1600w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl2-2xl.png 1920w"></figure><p>Also the orientation doesn't matter of the shape, you can make horizontal or vertical lines, upside down triangles, sideways triangles, squares at a 45 degree angle, anything, as long as the vertices match what you want. Simply just count the vertices and that's the dot, a triangle has 3 vertices, so that equals "3" or the 3rd group, "GHI" and a line has 2, the 2nd letter in the GHI group, just like that, we got "HI" but out of shapes. Then in class when I was experimenting with it, I realized.. "Wait what if I just flipped it upside down" Since the orientation of the shapes doesn't matter to me, you can make a upside down triangle, but now what if you got it upside down (the H and I on the top is just for guidance, if using for real, which I'd be surprised if you did, you wouldn't write the decoded letter above it) So what if you got it upside down, then it would look like this?</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/sl3.png" height="230" width="215" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl3-xs.png 640w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl3-sm.png 768w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl3-md.png 1024w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl3-lg.png 1366w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl3-xl.png 1600w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl3-2xl.png 1920w"></figure><p>Now it says "IF".. HUH? NO! I wanted to say Hi! NOT IF. So what did I do? make an orientation symbol. The orientation symbol is an "O" with a line under it. and it always goes on top of the code. So Hi would look like this now with V3 (my orientation symbol update lol)</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/sl4.png" height="321" width="214" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl4-xs.png 640w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl4-sm.png 768w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl4-md.png 1024w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl4-lg.png 1366w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl4-xl.png 1600w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl4-2xl.png 1920w"></figure><p>You just gotta follow the global rule of "O symbol is always above" now if i turn it any direction, the O symbol wouldn't be on top, which would signal to the reader to fix the orientation. Also, once when I wanted to write "S" I didn't feel like drawing a shape with 7 sides, so you can also put multiple shapes into a cell as long as the vertices add up to what you wanted&nbsp;originally, so a square and a triangle's vertice count adds up to 7, which would be the "STU" group. then draw a simple dot for the 1st letter in "STU", "S" and you got S. Here's an example:</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/sl5.png" height="262" width="162" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl5-xs.png 640w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl5-sm.png 768w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl5-md.png 1024w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl5-lg.png 1366w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl5-xl.png 1600w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl5-2xl.png 1920w"><figcaption>S</figcaption></figure><p>Now, here's a challenge, try decoding this, it's a bit hard, remember orientation!:</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/sl6.png" height="696" width="415" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl6-xs.png 640w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl6-sm.png 768w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl6-md.png 1024w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl6-lg.png 1366w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl6-xl.png 1600w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl6-2xl.png 1920w"></figure><p>(DO NOT SCROLL FURTHER UNLESS DONE OR AREN'T DOING IT, YOU WILL SEE THE ANSWER)</p><p>(DO NOT SCROLL FURTHER UNLESS DONE OR AREN'T DOING IT, YOU WILL SEE THE ANSWER)</p><p>(DO NOT SCROLL FURTHER UNLESS DONE OR AREN'T DOING IT, YOU WILL SEE THE ANSWER)</p><p>If you have trouble, the answer is YOUREAWESOME</p><p></p><p>Also the 2nd row should always have less than 4 vertices. Since letters are grouped in 3, and a group cannot have more than 3, if you see a square in the second row ( with correct orientation, of course) then it's a mistake since a square has 4 vertices</p><p>I also made another edition called "Additive", which instead of using groups and indexes of letters in those groups, uses the closest group to the letter, and the second row is addition to get to that letter. So D would be a single dot in the top row, which would be.. "ABC"? What??? Yes, in my first edition, that wouldn't make sense. But in this edition, the second row would be one more dot, which would signal "what's 1 letter after C?" which is D. so D would look like this in my Additive edition:</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/sl7.png" height="138" width="150" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl7-xs.png 640w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl7-sm.png 768w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl7-md.png 1024w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl7-lg.png 1366w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl7-xl.png 1600w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/10/responsive/sl7-2xl.png 1920w"></figure><p>The first row always equals the last letter of the group, so if you drew a triangle, which would mean the group "GHI", "I" would be the letter, then the second dot would be what you want to add, so if you want to write "K", you would make a triangle in the top row for "GHI", then the second row would have a line or any other two vertices shape, which would mean "I" + 2, which would be "K"</p><p>This is a really silly idea I had, if you want to try using it, have fun! Much thanks for reading. Also I know this isn't my usual tech stuff but I found it a fun post to make for those interested in encoding and stuff.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on December 6, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbyteafterlife.github.io%2Fprojects%2Fi-made-my-own-encoding-language-out-of-shapes%2F&amp;via=%40byteafterlife&amp;text=I%20made%20my%20own%20encoding%20language..%20out%20of%20shapes" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/authors/byte/" rel="author">Byte</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/bye-mumble-hello-jitsi/" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Bye Mumble, Hello Jitsi</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/ssh-tunneling-is-cooler-than-i-thought/" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> SSH tunneling is cooler than I thought</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/authors/byte/" class="feed__author">Byte</a> <time datetime="2025-11-30T13:00" class="feed__date">November 30, 2025</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/i-made-my-own-vpn/">I made my own VPN (second worldwide project)</a></h3></header><p>Everytime on my phone when I use my Mobile Data, or connect to an open wifi like at an airport or store, people say it's good to use a VPN, now when people think of VPNs they think of something that you pay for and&hellip;</p><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/i-made-my-own-vpn/" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Thanks for reading! &lt;3</p></div><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://x.com/byteafterlife" aria-label="X"><svg><use xlink:href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg></a></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');

It's simple, LAN, or worldwide through port forwarding. Back then, Keycloak was sufficient for SSO, because most apps supported the Security Assertation Markup Language (SAML) or OpenID Connect (OIDC). But if I ever add more old apps that don't support OIDC or SAML, they might support LDAP, LDAP is another protocol that's used to quickly get information on something, whether its a printer, a person (commonly), a document, and much more. I usually use LDAP for login, it's fast, it's existed since the 1990's, and it can store alot of stuff. But there's a con... it's hard to use. To some it may not be, but you need these stupid LDIF files or whatever to make any change. These LDIF files are basically instructions for what to change on the server, like make an account or update the password policy. Even with phpLDAPadmin, which is a web tool made to simplify LDAP management, it's still hard to use. Anyway, enterprise products or less flexible things like Microsoft's Active Directory or "LLDAP" exist, Active Directory is mostly paid though, and LLDAP is way less customizable. Anyway, if you want, here's how to connect an OpenLDAP server to keycloak if you store your users under "ou=people,dc=example"</p><p>First, in the keycloak admin console, go to User Federation, Add new provider, then LDAP, or if you haven't added a provider yet, it should say something like "Add LDAP Providers"</p><p>Anyway, here's the configuration I used, by the way I ran Keycloak and OpenLDAP in the same docker compose with the same docker network, so "ldap" worked as a hostname for the OpenLDAP server:</p><pre class="line-numbers language-html"><code>UI Display Name:   ldap

Enable StartTLS: Off  
Use Truststore SPI: (default)

All the kerberos stuff I just left off.
Cache policy: DEFAULT
Enable the LDAPv3 password modify extended operation: Off
Validate password policy: Off
Trust Email: on
Connection trace: (default)</code></pre><p>Then I realized something, if a user resets their password through keycloak, keycloak just stores it in plaintext on OpenLDAP, thats very bad. I doubt a server with like 5 people will get a data breach, but I like practicing. So I wrote an LDIF to make it so all password received get hashed by OpenLDAP itself, since keycloak won't do it (from what I know).</p><p>Here's the LDIF I wrote if you want it too:</p><pre class="line-numbers language-html"><code>dn: cn=config
changetype: modify
replace: olcPasswordHash
olcPasswordHash: {SSHA}
</code></pre><p>That enables SSHA hashing for each password, which is considered strong. Applying LDIF files to your server depends on what you're running it on (Docker, Windows, Linux, etc) and some other things I think exist but can't be bothered to think of right now, so just google "how to apply an ldif file to (your server information)" Anyway, then I realized something, after I applied the LDIF, I tested it with ldappasswd, which is a tool made for resetting peoples passwords on LDAP servers. And guess what? It worked! I sent a cleartext password, and OpenLDAP hashed it before storing it. But with keycloak, it was still storing it in plaintext! It took me 20 minutes, then I figured out the "Enable the LDAPv3 password modify extended operation" under Advanced settings was the problem. I honestly don't understand it much, but after enabling it, OpenLDAP started hashing passwords it got from Keycloak. Yay!</p><p>That's all for now, thanks for reading, and I hope I taught you something.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on January 19, 2026</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbyteafterlife.github.io%2Fprojects%2Fkeycloak-and-openldap-is-a-perfect-balance%2F&amp;via=%40byteafterlife&amp;text=Keycloak%20and%20OpenLDAP%20is%20a%20perfect%20balance" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/authors/byte/" rel="author">Byte</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/i-made-social-credit-for-cats-and-learned-so-much/" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> I made social credit for cats (and learned so much)</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/my-first-android-game/" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> My First Android Game</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/authors/byte/" class="feed__author">Byte</a> <time datetime="2025-11-29T08:19" class="feed__date">November 29, 2025</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/i-love-keycloak/">I love Keycloak</a></h3></header><p>Ever since a year ago I've been experimenting with keycloak&nbsp;and oh my it is beautiful!

One said I should make a car game where you have four lanes, and two cars, and there are objects along the path, stars and walls, when you touch a star, you get +1 score, if either car touches a wall, game over. So I took that and improved it a bit, I added high scores, and for each 5 stars you collect, it speeds everything up to make it more challenging. I used Godot 4 for this project, since I've been using godot to make some other games for a while now, but never exported to android. I had to solve a bunch of problems, such as most examples using syntax from Godot 3, settings, Android SDKs, and some other stuff. Here's a video of me playing.</p><div><video loading="lazy" controls><source src="/projects/media/files/Screen_Recording_20260125_133541_Untitled Car Lane Game.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></div><p>It took me around 6 hours to make, but again this is my first time making a godot 4 game in around 4 months, and my first ever android game entirely. Anyway, some challenges and how I solved them:</p><ul><li>Launching forced you into landscape mode (app was designed for portrait): It was a setting problem, I fixed it in project settings in Orientation</li><li>Couldn't export (couldn't find a keystore): Had to make something called a keystore to sign the app</li><li>When a car hit a wall and it said game over, it displayed the amount of stars only that car collected, not in total, for example if left car collected 10 stars, and right car collected 5, and right car hit a wall, it would show 5 as score, not 15 like it should: I made a global score manager</li></ul><pre class="line-numbers language-html"><code>extends Node

var total_score = 0


func add_score(amount: int):
	total_score += amount


func reset_score():
	total_score = 0

func get_score() -&gt; int:
	return total_score
</code></pre><p>and made both cars use that each time they collect a star</p><p>Also on the game over screen, the fact the objects continue to appear is intentional, and I find it a cool effect while you stare at the game over screen.</p><p>Fun P.S. So I was trying to export the game, then Google Play Protect wanted to scan it, I let it, it said the app is safe, then all I changed in godot was the app icon from the godot logo to the star texture, I tried reinstalling on my phone, and Google Play Protect said the app is harmful and tries to spy on SMS and emails.. ALL I CHANGED WAS THE ICON!? WHAT?? Also how would it? It doesnt request any permissions. Not even storage. It stores your highscore in app data, not on your filesystem. So it doesn't ask for any permissions, no email permissions, no sms reading permission, so how would it even do that? I don't understand. I changed it to the red car texture in the game and now it says its safe. Great.</p><p>Anyway if you want to try it, here's a <a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/files/export.apk">download link</a>, I haven't linked much of my projects on this blog because they usually involve some sort of social or interaction which is meant to be private, but this is a basic singleplayer game, so I don't see why not.</p><p>As always, thanks for reading!</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on January 25, 2026</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbyteafterlife.github.io%2Fprojects%2Fmy-first-android-game%2F&amp;via=%40byteafterlife&amp;text=My%20First%20Android%20Game" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/authors/byte/" rel="author">Byte</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/keycloak-and-openldap-is-a-perfect-balance/" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Keycloak and OpenLDAP is a perfect balance</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/authors/byte/" class="feed__author">Byte</a> <time datetime="2025-11-29T09:09" class="feed__date">November 29, 2025</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/using-linux-as-my-main-os-for-the-first-time/">Using Linux as my Main OS for the first time</a></h3></header><p>Ever since August 2024, I've been using Linux as my main OS.

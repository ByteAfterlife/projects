Now I've run plenty of servers before that are only accessible on my LAN. Simplified, the way networking works (if you wanna know in more detail, read <a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/networking/">this post</a>) is unless you change some settings on your router, any server your computer runs cannot be seen by the rest of the world, it can only be accessed on people that are on the same network (are connected to the same wifi as you or ethernet or whatever you use to connect) as you. If not, they cannot access it. But, today I decided is the day I make it accessible anywhere. Firstly, I setup the Mumble server itself with <a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/the-docker-rabbit-hole/">Docker</a>, then I tested it. It works. Now was the hard part, the part I never did before. To those who have done this before, it may seem small, but this was my first time, it was really exciting! So I went into my parents router settings (they don't mind), and looked up how to setup port forwarding on my router model (it was pretty complicated) but eventually it worked! I had to make a "custom service," specify ports, connect it to my computer through some weird UI, but in the end, I did it! I got it so if you connect to port&nbsp;64738 (default mumble port) through my public IP (the magical number the world uses to connect to your servers and router) it routes you to my computer's mumble server! Perfect.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/5/Screenshot-from-2025-11-29-08-52-00.png" height="144" width="619" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/5/responsive/Screenshot-from-2025-11-29-08-52-00-xs.png 640w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/5/responsive/Screenshot-from-2025-11-29-08-52-00-sm.png 768w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/5/responsive/Screenshot-from-2025-11-29-08-52-00-md.png 1024w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/5/responsive/Screenshot-from-2025-11-29-08-52-00-lg.png 1366w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/5/responsive/Screenshot-from-2025-11-29-08-52-00-xl.png 1600w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/5/responsive/Screenshot-from-2025-11-29-08-52-00-2xl.png 1920w"><figcaption>"AONEM" is the nickname I gave for mumble, HTTP was also needed because later on I got a Lets Encrypt certificate for SSL, which was also a big achievement</figcaption></figure><p>But now here's another problem.. most home routers change your public IP, that's bad. By the way, this mumble server was just for me and my family to decentralise from corporations and whatnot. So if the public IP changed, my family would need to change it all on their computers too, that would be annoying and a waste of time. So I realized something. You know domains right? Like example.com, or example.org, well, those are kind of aliases for IP addresses, like google.com is pointing to 142.250.191.142 as of the time I'm writing this,&nbsp;142.250.191.142 is google's public IP right now, don't believe me? Go open your browser, and type&nbsp;142.250.191.142 as the URL. Magic right? Nope, just <a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/networking/">networking</a>&nbsp;basics. So anyway, the thing is.. these aliases can change. So what if instead of asking my family to use the public IP of my router as the address to connect to the Mumble server and have to manually change it everytime my router changes it's public IP, what if instead, I just got a domain, and anytime the public IP changed, I update the IP the domain is pointing to. This is actually a popular concept known as "Dynamic DNS" which from what I understood does exactly what I needed. Well, here's the problem, domains cost money. But, theres a free service that allows you to get free subdomains. So I got all the puzzle peices now! I got a domain, my port forwarding setup, the mumble server works. Now I just need to setup the domain and everything should work, right? Well, you'll find out later. So I made the domain record, setup Dynamic DNS by making a quick script that gets my public IP every 15 minutes, and sends it to the domain, if it changed, the domain forwards to my new public IP, if not, nothing changes. That's basically dynamic DNS, here's my script if you want. I had to censor alot because it includes login credentials and other private stuff.</p><pre class="line-numbers language-html"><code>  #!/bin/bash
USERNAME="(secret)"
PASSWORD='(secret)'
DOMAIN="(secret, kinda).privatedns.org"
IP=$(curl -s https://ipv4.icanhazip.com)

curl -k "https://${USERNAME}:${PASSWORD}@(secret)/nic/update?hostname=${DOMAIN}&myip=${IP}"

</code></pre><p>Since I'm using linux, I setup something called a "cron" job (that is basically an automated task scheduler) to run this script every 15 minutes. And guess what? It worked. If my public IP ever changes, my family just needs to wait a max of 15 minutes before my computer detects it and the domain is realigned with my router's new IP.</p><p>Now, an even bigger thing I never done before, get an actual certificate! Certificates, in simple, encrypt your connection with websites, almost every uses them, this blog uses it, Google uses it, as I said, almost every website in the world does, it makes sure nobody except the website can see what you're sending to the website, like your name and password, and it makes sure nobody except you can see what the website sent back, like your bank balance or email address or phone number. Certificates can be made with a "custom CA" but devices only trust a specific list of CAs, so what's a CA, again I'm simplifying this but basically it's a trusted organization that issues these certificates, the most popular one for website certificates is Lets Encrypt, they're trusted very very widely. So, I put my domain into lets encrypt and basically asked them for a certificate, this is necessary because it encrypts the voice communication between the mumble server I made and my family so nobody can eavesdrop. Then they told me I need a http server to prove I own the server, which I also had to setup and port forward. But after a whole bunch of work, I got a certificate, I also decided to setup another cron job to renew the certificate everyday at 3am. That's the story of my Mumble server journey. Hope you learned something!</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on November 29, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbyteafterlife.github.io%2Fprojects%2Fmy-first-worldwide-project-mumble%2F&amp;via=%40byteafterlife&amp;text=My%20first%20worldwide%20project%20(Mumble)" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/authors/byte/" rel="author">Byte</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/sick-of-cloud-storage-fees-try-nextcloud/" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Sick of cloud storage fees?

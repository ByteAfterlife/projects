But this time, it was different, I had to make the database the server and use RLS and other database stuff for security.</p><p>I decided to take a break from self hosting and instead make worldwide apps via cloud providers this time.</p><p>Alright hold on back it up firstly.. how did I come up with this idea in the first place? Great question, I was laying, looked at my cat, and then.. "I just got an idea"</p><p>Anyway, theres a whole different type of apps that I like to call "Direct Database Clients" which basically means instead of there being a server between you and the database, and the server doing access verification, the database server itself uses a bunch of stuff like RLS and functions and triggers and stuff to verify if you're allowed to access or change what you want. I never made something like this EVER before, so it was pretty complicated.</p><p>Anyway, firstly I got to the drawing board. Here was my idea: People register cats, each cat has a profile photo, name, and a bio! And it's also obviously tied to you. Next, each cat has social credit, and theres leaderboards, like which has the most, or least, or longest name, or anything that I think of. But to change your cats social credit you have to make "cases", where you upload a video, give a short description of what it proves, and state how much it should affect your cats social credit. For example, I could take a video of my cat falling off the couch, then the description would be "(my cat) fell off the couch!" and the effect should be -10 social credit, because I believe my cat should lose that much because he fell off the couch lol. Anyway, then others vote on your case, and if you get 3 or more voted, then its considered "processed" and the cat's social credit was changed how it was stated when you made the case.</p><p>Now how would I implement this? Well get ready cause I had to do alot. The first thing that came to mind was storage. How do I store photos of people's cats, or their evidence videos? Well, over the years I learned alot of free tools that help me do stuff since I dont get any funding for any of these projects, and they're just for fun, but since I believe in Tragedy of the Commons, I won't share any tool names, sorry! Anyway, I found a storage system that integrates directly with my database provider. And now was the part I never done before: Connect directly to a database with client side javascript, so I got something called a "public" key, which was intended to be used clientside, so then I figured out they quite literally had everything I needed, authentication, a storage system, and databases, all on the same platform, perfect. So now how it worked is: Me and my friends login with discord then we get an access token, which can be used to upload stuff to the storage system and directly update the database. Now of course, I trust my friends, I know they wouldn't drop all tables (if you know nothing about databases, that basically permanently deletes all your data) probably. But still, I wanted to practice, especially since it was my first time making this type of app (that connects directly to storage and databases) So, after 6 hours of setting up soo many security things it was wild I swear, here's a rundown though of some big moments:</p><p>For the case votes, I tried storing them in a column inside the case itself with a uuid[] type, uuid means a unique ID for a user or something else, and the [] means its a table, it can have multiple values, but then I had a huge problem when trying to make it so people can only add or remove themselves from the table, eventually I gave up with it and made a new table with just two columns: case_id, and user_id, that was way easier to manage. Also, a bunch of times, for update policies (policies that run when you change a record) when I needed to check the old value before the new one, RLS doesn't have an OLD attribute (at least on my database provider) so I had to figure out functions.</p><p>I also at first thought the way social credit would be calculated would be each time the page loads, the user loads each case associated with a cat, checks the votes, if theres more than 3, it clientside calculates the social credit, that was very inefficient, and also I have limited database storage obviously on a free plan, so I needed something more optimized, so instead I made a function (a function can do more than RLS, like execute code on other tables, where RLS can only check rows in your current table) that when a vote is created for a case in my case votes table, if theres now 3 votes including this one, delete the case to save storage, update the cat's social credit directly by updating the new "social_credit" column on each cat, that saves database storage, but sadly since functions couldn't access the user storage part to delete the evidence file of the case, I just added it to a table that I have to manually check and delete the files manually. But now there was a problem, since people had update permission on their cat's to change the name or bio, they could also just directly update their cats social credit score to like "9999999" or something, that's not good. So I had to do some debugging, and guess what? The same internal database user that executes user created queries (like if I personally set the cats social credit score to 9999) also executes functions, like the one thats supposed to be able to change the cats social credit score. That's very bad. So I hit a brick wall, nothing online told me how to fix it, then I did some debugging by myself and somehow figured it out.. I'm starting to notice I'm really fixing lots of undocumented errors on things. Like in my <a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/jitsi-is-complicated-how-i-fixed-it-is-wild/">Jitsi series</a></p><p>Another issue I ran into was the displaying the owner name under cats, see people couldn't really access the system table used for authentication, so I had to make a bridge function that basically whenever someone signed up (one of my friends) or their discord name changed, it would copy that into a table which sole purpose is just to store their user ID and their display name, and also a value called "can_view" which with RLS I made it so you cant get someones discord username if their can_view is FALSE, at first it was broken, but eventually I got it to work after alot of revisions.</p><p>Anyway, then I had to make pages to connect to the database. Making the pages and the leaderboards and the whole database side security was pretty complicated... but what did I expect, this is my first time making this type of app as I said.</p><p>For the leaderboard, if social credit ties, my super duper smart algorithm decides who gets 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place, you're not ready... whichever cat name comes first alphabetically gets the higher place and so on if a tie happens. I know so smart.</p><p>I also decided to use discord for login in the end because I didn't feel like storing passwords, and on Cat Index, people can see that you own a cat if you allow it using a setting in the top right.</p><p>I also decided to make the homepage a windows xp styled window manager thing that just iframes the pages (leaderboard, cases, cat index)&nbsp;and adds buttons. The red refresh icon refreshes you, so if you for example went to the cat creation page from the cases window and you're stuck, pressing the refresh button takes you back to the cases page. The Maximize button fullscreens the "window". Like this:</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/16/Untitled-2025-11-07-1049.png" height="1140" width="2011" alt="Fullscreened iframe" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/16/responsive/Untitled-2025-11-07-1049-xs.png 640w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/16/responsive/Untitled-2025-11-07-1049-sm.png 768w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/16/responsive/Untitled-2025-11-07-1049-md.png 1024w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/16/responsive/Untitled-2025-11-07-1049-lg.png 1366w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/16/responsive/Untitled-2025-11-07-1049-xl.png 1600w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/16/responsive/Untitled-2025-11-07-1049-2xl.png 1920w"><figcaption>Fullscreened iframe</figcaption></figure><p>You can also minimize windows, which removes a green little bar on the bottom that was supposed to make the aesthetic look more like windows xp.

Absolutely! Forget social media platforms we now have cat social credit media.. lol.</p><p>Some P.S. 1. when I was debating whether setting up a policy to only let you make cases about your own cat, I decided not to because if you have an incriminating video of your friends cat (like if it fell off the couch) you can make a case on your friends cat. Also, if you don't attach any evidence for a case (no picture or video) then it just says "Trust me bro" as the evidence hehe</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/16/Screenshot-from-2025-12-29-09-36-46.png" height="148" width="346" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/16/responsive/Screenshot-from-2025-12-29-09-36-46-xs.png 640w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/16/responsive/Screenshot-from-2025-12-29-09-36-46-sm.png 768w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/16/responsive/Screenshot-from-2025-12-29-09-36-46-md.png 1024w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/16/responsive/Screenshot-from-2025-12-29-09-36-46-lg.png 1366w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/16/responsive/Screenshot-from-2025-12-29-09-36-46-xl.png 1600w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/16/responsive/Screenshot-from-2025-12-29-09-36-46-2xl.png 1920w"></figure><p>EDIT 2: Jan 4 2026</p><p>Some updates (also happy new years!) So I made it so when you make a case or a cat, it also sends it as a Discord webhook into a channel. I also then had to optimize my loading because my storage provider (they store all the cat images and case videos and photos) has a monthly limit on how many times this can be requested, and since we're loading the cat index, leaderboard, and cases, all in the background, even if the user never uses it, we're loading each cat's photo almost 3 times (one for leaderboard, another for index, another for case data) and their social credit score and stuff, that's bad. So I made it so the new "desktop" doesn't load the cat index in the background. Did I mention in the original version, cat index was minimised by default? Anyway, it is. But it's still loaded in the background, so I made it so its not loaded at all until you actually open it (this saved alot of loading usage) and also I made it so the leader board is still open but it doesn't actually load, instead theres a button that says "Load leaderboard" and when you press it then it actually loads the leaderboard and gets the cat images and stuff. I also made a super cool loading animation with a cat logo I drew on the desktop by making an SVG path out of the photo and figuring out how to trace it with an animation, I never done that before either so I'm learning alot with this project. Even design. Anyway this is what the loading animation looks like</p><div><video loading="lazy" controls><source src="/projects/media/files/2026-01-04%2013-30-46.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></div><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/16/Screenshot-from-2026-01-04-13-35-53.png" height="382" width="600" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/16/responsive/Screenshot-from-2026-01-04-13-35-53-xs.png 640w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/16/responsive/Screenshot-from-2026-01-04-13-35-53-sm.png 768w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/16/responsive/Screenshot-from-2026-01-04-13-35-53-md.png 1024w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/16/responsive/Screenshot-from-2026-01-04-13-35-53-lg.png 1366w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/16/responsive/Screenshot-from-2026-01-04-13-35-53-xl.png 1600w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/16/responsive/Screenshot-from-2026-01-04-13-35-53-2xl.png 1920w"><figcaption>Screenshot of the discord webhook messages for case/cat creation</figcaption></figure><p>I also made it so when uploading a case or cat, while its uploading the photo of the cat or evidence of the case, and while the server is processing the webhook to discord, it says "Uploading" and disables the button so people with slow internet don't think nothing happened and retry the request. Because before it showed no indicator that it was actually doing anything. You clicked upload and it just did nothing until it was done and then showed a confirmation message that it worked.</p><p>I also changed the background color of the cases and cat index to dark gray because its much easier on the eyes than white.</p><p>Here's some more screenshots.</p><div class="gallery-wrapper gallery-wrapper--wide"><div class="gallery" data-columns="3"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/16/gallery/Screenshot-from-2026-01-04-13-41-07.png" data-size="926x763"><img loading="lazy" src="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/16/gallery/Screenshot-from-2026-01-04-13-41-07-thumbnail.png" height="593" width="720" alt=""></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/16/gallery/Screenshot-from-2026-01-04-13-38-14.png" data-size="1563x888"><img loading="lazy" src="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/16/gallery/Screenshot-from-2026-01-04-13-38-14-thumbnail.png" height="409" width="720" alt=""></a></figure></div></div><p>Another update I realized I needed to make is for case evidence loading, in my original logic, you could make cases on other peoples cat's if you had evidence on them lol. But I realized the way the code loaded the evidence is it assumed the cat owner made the case still. This was because in the cases database table, it only had the case id, when it was made, which cat it was made for, the title, filepath (only the name of the file, not the userid), and the proposed social credit score change. This was ok if only the cat owner was making cases on their cats because the cases index looked up the cat ID in the cats table, then got the owner ID, and assumed the evidence was in the owner of the cat's folder, but since others could make cases on their cat, the evidence would be in the other persons folder, not in the cat owner's folder. Now I could've just made it so you can specify the user in the folder, like "(creator_id)/(evidence.png or jpg or whatever)" but I decided to kill two birds with one stone and instead just add a new column called "creator_id" which is the user ID of the person who made the case, so now the case index uses (creator_id)/(filepath) to load evidence. That fixed the issue where evidence for someone else's cat didn't work. Yay!</p><p>That's all I can think of, I probably made more updates but I can't name them right now. Sorry!</p><p>Either way my point with this whole project is 2 things: The silliest projects can teach you so many things (I learned SVG and CSS animation, direct connection to databases without an intermediate server for access control which is actually used in many real world examples, storage buckets and processing user created media, alot of UX, and postgres access control) and that you CAN have fun making apps.</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on January 4, 2026</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbyteafterlife.github.io%2Fprojects%2Fi-made-social-credit-for-cats-and-learned-so-much%2F&amp;via=%40byteafterlife&amp;text=I%20made%20social%20credit%20for%20cats%20(and%20learned%20so%20much)" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/authors/byte/" rel="author">Byte</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/i-did-not-expect-to-learn-this-while-making-a-jitsi-server/" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> I did not expect to learn this while making a Jitsi server</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/authors/byte/" class="feed__author">Byte</a> <time datetime="2025-12-06T09:57" class="feed__date">December 6, 2025</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/i-made-my-own-encoding-language-out-of-shapes/">I made my own encoding language.. out of shapes</a></h3></header><p>Firstly, I'll just say, I get lots of ideas that I then later discover were thought of like 2 decades ago by someone else, so if this is another one of those times and someone already made this, then sorry, I didn't research it or&hellip;</p><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/i-made-my-own-encoding-language-out-of-shapes/" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/authors/byte/" class="feed__author">Byte</a> <time datetime="2025-11-30T13:00" class="feed__date">November 30, 2025</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/i-made-my-own-vpn/">I made my own VPN (second worldwide project)</a></h3></header><p>Everytime on my phone when I use my Mobile Data, or connect to an open wifi like at an airport or store, people say it's good to use a VPN, now when people think of VPNs they think of something that you pay for and&hellip;</p><a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/i-made-my-own-vpn/" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Thanks for reading! &lt;3</p></div><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://x.com/byteafterlife" aria-label="X"><svg><use xlink:href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg></a></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');

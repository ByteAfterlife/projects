But, the way VPNs work is basically you pay to be able to connect to a network of computers that are told to forward your network requests (loading a webpage, making a search, logging in, etc) through them. It's actually really easy to make your own VPN server, and it probably costs less too, get a VPS (not a VPN) which is basically your own computer in the cloud that you rent, yes it's still paid, what do you expect. It functions just like you owned a computer at your house, except its in the cloud, now you run VPN software on it (OpenVPN, WireGuard, etc), set it up, connect, and you're done, now anywhere you go, your IP is now of the cloud computer that you're renting. However since I don't get funded for any of my projects, what if instead of running this VPN software on a cloud computer, I ran it on my own? I trust my own wifi router more than some random coffee shop wifi anyway, so I setup my very own WireGuard server, and then configured it on my phone, yes by the way I had to also setup port forwarding and firewalls, I'm trying to expand my knowledge of port forwarding and know better at making worldwide accessible servers from my computer, like the <a href="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/my-first-worldwide-project-mumble/">Mumble server</a> I made 2 days ago, which also involved port forwarding and firewall config. Anyway back to WireGuard, now, here's the flow</p><p>My phone connects to mobile data or a public wifi &gt; I turn connect to my laptop's worldwide accessible VPN &gt; Any network traffic I do like searching or loading a webpage is extremely hard to be seen by the admins of the wifi I connected to &gt; My laptop makes the network request using my router at home &gt; router completes the request &gt; sends it to my laptop which sends it back to my phone, done.</p><p>Here's an example if I wanted to search "hi" on google: Phone searches hi (connected to my laptop VPN) &gt; Laptop searches it up using the home Wifi, as if I was at home and I searched "hi" using the home wifi &gt; the router responds and gives me the results &gt; my laptop returns it back to my phone which could be wherever in the world.</p><p>Of course I used docker to keep my docker skills sharp.</p><p>Heres a mobile screenshot</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/8/Screenshot_20251130_155702_WireGuard.jpg" height="2340" width="1080" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/8/responsive/Screenshot_20251130_155702_WireGuard-xs.jpg 640w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/8/responsive/Screenshot_20251130_155702_WireGuard-sm.jpg 768w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/8/responsive/Screenshot_20251130_155702_WireGuard-md.jpg 1024w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/8/responsive/Screenshot_20251130_155702_WireGuard-lg.jpg 1366w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/8/responsive/Screenshot_20251130_155702_WireGuard-xl.jpg 1600w, https://byteafterlife.github.io/projects/media/posts/8/responsive/Screenshot_20251130_155702_WireGuard-2xl.jpg 1920w"></figure><p>This is now my second worldwide accessible project EVER.
